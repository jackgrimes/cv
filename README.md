## Dependencies

1. Compiles only with **XeTeX** and required **BibTex** for compiling publications and the .bib filetype.

## Known Issues:
1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the vertical limit
2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.
3. Hacky redefinition of \refname to omit 'References' text for publications in the MacFonts version.
